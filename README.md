## Hi there 👋

I am a passionate fresher learning Full Stack Development, focused on building real-world web applications.

I have hands-on experience with Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, HTML, and CSS, and have worked on projects like a Dance Class Management System with backend, database, and UI integration.

Quick learner, consistent, and eager to grow as a developer.
Actively looking for an entry-level opportunity or internship in Full Stack Development.
